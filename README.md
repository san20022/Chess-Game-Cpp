# Simplified Chess Game (C++)

This project is a simplified console-based chess game developed in **C++**.  
It allows two players (White and Black) to take turns moving chess pieces on an 8x8 board, capture opponent pieces, and win by capturing the enemy king.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate core C++ programming concepts such as **conditionals, loops, functions, classes, STL containers, and file input/output**.

## Instructions for Build and Use

[Software Demo](https://www.kaltura.com//p/1157612/embedPlaykitJs/uiconf_id/56813562?iframeembed=true&entry_id=1_xk6ehjrn)

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code (or any C++ compatible IDE).
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler such as `clang++` or `g++`.
4. Run the generated executable file to start the game.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* macOS (tested on macOS Sonoma)
* Visual Studio Code (latest version)
* C++ Compiler (clang++ via Xcode Command Line Tools)
* Git (for version control)
* GitHub (for repository hosting)
* C++ Standard Library (STL)

No external libraries were required; the project only uses built-in C++ STL.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add check and checkmate detection.
* [ ] Add special chess rules such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
* [ ] Add move history log.
* [ ] Improve board display for better readability.
* [ ] Add advanced validation to prevent illegal moves.
