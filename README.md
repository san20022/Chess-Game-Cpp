# Simplified Chess Game (C++)

This project is a simplified console-based chess game developed in **C++**.  
It allows two players (White and Black) to take turns moving chess pieces on an 8x8 board, capture opponent pieces, and win by capturing the enemy king.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate core C++ programming concepts such as **conditionals, loops, functions, classes, STL containers, and file input/output**.
